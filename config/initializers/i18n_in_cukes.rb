# The following bit of code patches rspec to accept i18n codes in all finders and when looking for text.
# This way labels don't have to be hardcoded which means they can be changed without breaking tests.
# Examples:
#
#   Given I click on "t:account.delete"
#   When I follow "t:label_register"
#   And I press "t:button_login"
#
# Where the i18n file contains the following:
#
#   en:
#     label_register: "Sign up"
#     label_button_login: "Sign in"
#
#     account:
#       delete: "Delete account"
#
